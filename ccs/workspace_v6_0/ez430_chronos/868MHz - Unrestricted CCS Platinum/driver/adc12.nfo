Build Number 1OFOQ-0QRTSXTX-UARAR-TAQ-ZACIF_U_T_T

		======File-level Analysis Summary======


extern void ADC12ISR() is called from 0 sites in this file.
    It has 3 non-trivial scope blocks nested 3 deep.
    It calls these functions:
	__bic_SR_register_on_exit() (1 times)

extern unsigned adc12_single_conversion() is called from 0 sites in this file.
    It appears to be inlineable (size = 73 units)
    It has 3 non-trivial scope blocks nested 3 deep.
    It calls these functions:
	Timer0_A4_Delay() (2 times)


These functions may be recursive:
	ADC12ISR()
	adc12_single_conversion()

These external functions are called but not defined here:
	Timer0_A4_Delay()
	__bic_SR_register_on_exit()
