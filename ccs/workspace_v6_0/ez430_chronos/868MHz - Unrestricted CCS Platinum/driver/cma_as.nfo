    It appears to be inlineable (size = 22 units)
    It has 3 non-trivial scope blocks nested 3 deep.
    It calls these functions:
	cma_as_read_register() (3 times)

extern unsigned char cma_as_read_register() is called from 3 sites in this file.
    It appears to be inlineable (size = 6 units)
    It has 3 non-trivial scope blocks nested 3 deep.

extern unsigned char cma_as_write_register() is called from 4 sites in this file.
    It appears to be inlineable (size = 11 units)
    It has 3 non-trivial scope blocks nested 3 deep.
    It calls these functions:
	as_write_register() (1 times)


These functions may be recursive:
	cma_as_get_data()
	cma_as_read_register()
	cma_as_start()
	cma_as_stop()
	cma_as_write_register()

Making this function inlineable: cma_as_write_register()

Making this function inlineable: cma_as_read_register()

These external functions are called but not defined here:
	as_write_register()
	as_stop()
	as_start()
	Timer0_A4_Delay()
	as_read_register()
