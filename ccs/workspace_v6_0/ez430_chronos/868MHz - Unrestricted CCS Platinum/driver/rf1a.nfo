These functions may be recursive:
	ReadBurstReg()
	ResetRadioCore()
	Strobe()
	ReadSingleReg()
	WriteBurstReg()
	WritePATable()
	WriteSingleReg()

Making this function inlineable: ReadSingleReg()

These external functions are called but not defined here:
	__delay_cycles()
	__get_interrupt_state()
	__disable_interrupt()
	__set_interrupt_state()
