extern unsigned char cma_ps_write_register() is called from 3 sites in this file.
    It appears to be inlineable (size = 7 units)
    It has 3 non-trivial scope blocks nested 3 deep.
    It calls these functions:
	ps_write_register() (1 times)


These functions may be recursive:
	cma_ps_get_pa()
	cma_ps_get_temp()
	cma_ps_init()
	cma_ps_read_register()
	cma_ps_start()
	cma_ps_stop()
	cma_ps_write_register()

Making this function inlineable: cma_ps_write_register()

Making this function inlineable: cma_ps_read_register()

These external functions are called but not defined here:
	ps_write_register()
	ps_read_register()
	ps_init()
	Timer0_A4_Delay()
