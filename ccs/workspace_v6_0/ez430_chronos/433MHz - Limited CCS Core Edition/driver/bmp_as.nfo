		======File-level Analysis Summary======


extern void bmp_as_get_data() is called from 0 sites in this file.
    It appears to be inlineable (size = 35 units)
    It has 3 non-trivial scope blocks nested 3 deep.
    It calls these functions:
	bmp_as_read_register() (6 times)

extern unsigned char bmp_as_read_register() is called from 6 sites in this file.
    It appears to be inlineable (size = 6 units)
    It has 3 non-trivial scope blocks nested 3 deep.
    It calls these functions:
	as_read_register() (1 times)

extern void bmp_as_start() is called from 0 sites in this file.
    It appears to be inlineable (size = 48 units)
    It has 3 non-trivial scope blocks nested 3 deep.
    It calls these functions:
	bmp_as_write_register() (5 times)
	as_start() (1 times)

extern void bmp_as_stop() is called from 0 sites in this file.

extern unsigned char bmp_as_write_register() is called from 5 sites in this file.
    It appears to be inlineable (size = 6 units)
    It has 3 non-trivial scope blocks nested 3 deep.
    It calls these functions:
	as_write_register() (1 times)


These functions may be recursive:
	bmp_as_get_data()
	bmp_as_read_register()
	bmp_as_start()
	bmp_as_stop()
	bmp_as_write_register()

Making this function inlineable: bmp_as_write_register()

Making this function inlineable: bmp_as_read_register()

These external functions are called but not defined here:
	as_write_register()
	as_stop()
	as_start()
	as_read_register()
