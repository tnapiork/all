		======File-level Analysis Summary======


extern void as_init() is called from 0 sites in this file.
    It appears to be inlineable (size = 28 units)
    It has 3 non-trivial scope blocks nested 3 deep.
    It calls these functions:
	<NONE>

extern unsigned char as_read_register() is called from 0 sites in this file.
    It appears to be inlineable (size = 77 units)
    It has 3 non-trivial scope blocks nested 3 deep.
    It calls these functions:
	<NONE>

extern void as_start() is called from 0 sites in this file.
    It appears to be inlineable (size = 30 units)
    It has 3 non-trivial scope blocks nested 3 deep.
    It calls these functions:
	Timer0_A4_Delay() (1 times)

extern void as_stop() is called from 0 sites in this file.
    It appears to be inlineable (size = 28 units)
    It has 3 non-trivial scope blocks nested 3 deep.
